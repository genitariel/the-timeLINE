		Highschool was... very interesting. Half was spent
		<br>chatting away at school and the other half was spent cooped up at home.
		<br>But overall, I had a nice time I guess. It was okay, There were some ups and downs
		<br>but I somehow managed to get through it all, haha.
		<br>I feel like a lot of my highschool days are easily forgettable. There's definitely some
		<br>extremely memorable memories for me though. Overall, it was okay. I give Highschool a 3 out of 5. 
		<br>Let's hope that Senior High has better things in store haha

		My experience in high school was sad to say, very tiring and difficult.
		<br>Despite all that I encourage myself to do my best as I recall that through school,
		<br>I have met many amazing people and the best I chose to be my friends.
		<br>We have gone through many caring and loving advisers who not only take you as a student
		<br>but as their very own child. 
		<br>It has helped me improve my knowledge and skills. 
		<br>High school has been a wonderful experience for me.

		My high school years were fun, I really liked being able to spend time with my friends 
		<br>and do fun things together. Like joining clubs and expressing my ideas about it. 
		<br>I do remember teachers taking my phone and not giving it back to me for three days. 
		<br>The past few years have been very special to me. I have learned a lot. 
		<br>I'm looking forward to being a grade 11 student and to having a good school year.

		High school was a fun and enjoyable experience. 
		<br>I grew up and made a lot of new friends. Since my freshman days, 
		<br>TLE has been hard for me, but since the teacher teaches us well, I can recover from it. 
		<br>High school will be a memorable year for me. 
		<br>I can confirm it and will never regret it.

		In High School, I haven't had many experiences 
		<br>due to the fact that I wasn't very active during that time. 
		<br>I was very immersed in my studies; busy studying all the time.
		<br>But now, I realise from this is that I should relax every now and then.

		 Highschool was a really busy time, but also a time of growth and learning for me. 
		 <br>I liked being with my friends but at the same time I also had my own responsibilities I was dealing with.
		 <br>I'm thankful for all the amazing teachers I've had through the years, 
		 <br>and all the memories and lessons I've gotten as time passed.
